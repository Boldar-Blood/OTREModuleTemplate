## Goals of the SAT

- The SAT measures **college readiness**.
- Used by colleges for **admissions**, **scholarships**, and **course placement**.

---

## Raw Scores & Timing

- **No penalty** for wrong answers.
- **R&W:** **22** required for harder 2nd R&W section
- **Math:** **17** required for harder 2nd Math section
- **Timing:** **64 min** for Reading & Writing, **70 min** for Math.
- **Section Breakdown:**

| Section            | Modules | Questions | Time |
|--------------------|:------:|:---------:|:----:|
| Reading & Writing  |   2    |    54     | 64m  |
| Math               |   2    |    44     | 70m  |
| Total               |   4    |    98     | 134m  |

---

## Adaptive Structure

- **Module 1:** Same baseline difficulty for everyone.  
- **Module 2:** Adapts based on Module 1 performance.  
- **Goal:** Challenge appropriately and measure skills accurately.

---

## Scoring: IRT & Equating

- **Item Response Theory (IRT):** Accounts for **question difficulty** when scoring.
- **Equating:** Ensures fairness across test forms.
- **Conversion:** **Raw score → Scaled score → Final SAT score**.

---

## Preparation Tips

- Simulate **real exam conditions** with full-length tests.
- Use **time-blocking** (e.g., Pomodoros) for focused practice.
- Keep a **Reflection Log** to track mistakes, patterns, and fixes.

**Reflection Log**

| Date | Section | Q# | Question Type | Why it happened | Fix / Strategy |
|-----:|:-------:|:--:|:----------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| 10/15 | R&W | 12 | Inference | Skimmed evidence | Slow down, underline clues |

---

## Quiz 1 — Check Understanding

1) What is the SAT designed to measure?  
2) How many questions are in the **Reading & Writing** section?  
3) What happens in the second module of the adaptive test?  
4) How does **IRT** affect your score?  
5) Why is **equating** used in SAT scoring?

::: notes
Answers:
1) College readiness / skills for higher ed  
2) 54  
3) Difficulty adapts based on Module 1 performance  
4) Adjusts scoring based on question difficulty  
5) Ensures fairness across versions

## General Strategies (All Sections)

- **Pace Yourself:** Don’t over-invest in one question.  
- **POE (Process of Elimination):** Remove clearly wrong choices.  
- **Answer Every Question:** No penalty for guessing.  
- **Revisit Flagged Items:** If time remains, return and verify.

---

## Core Strategies: Reading & Writing

- **Read Actively:** Annotate, underline key terms, margin notes.  
- **Evidence-Based Thinking:** Support answers with text evidence.  
- **Author’s Purpose & Tone:** Guide main idea and inference Qs.  
- **Words in Context:** Infer meaning from usage.  
- **Avoid Assumptions:** Stick to the text.

---

## R&W: Information & Ideas

- **Central Ideas:** Identify main ideas + supports.  
- **Command of Evidence:** Locate supporting lines.  
- **Inferences:** Draw logical conclusions.

---

## R&W: Craft & Structure

- **Words in Context:** Function/meaning in passage.  
- **Text Structure:** Cause–effect, compare–contrast, etc.  
- **Cross-Text Comparisons:** Relate ideas across passages.

---

## R&W: Expression of Ideas

- **Rhetorical Synthesis:** Improve clarity, tone, logic.  
- **Transitions:** Smooth connections between ideas.

---

## R&W: Standard English Conventions

- **Punctuation:** Sentence boundaries, clarity.  
- **Grammar:** Structure, agreement, tense, parallelism.

---

## Core Strategies: Math

- **Write Out Your Work:** Reduce careless errors.  
- **Use Estimation:** Rule out implausible answers.  
- **Check Your Work:** Ensure it fits the context.
- **DESMOS it!** Take advantage of DESMOS features to save time and increase accuracy.

---

## Math: Algebra

- **Linear Equations (1 var)**  
- **Systems of Equations**  
- **Inequalities** (solve/graph)

---

## Math: Advanced Math

- **Nonlinear Functions:** Quadratic, exponential, polynomial.  
- **Equivalent Expressions:** Simplify/manipulate forms.

---

## Math: Problem Solving & Data Analysis

- **Ratios & Proportions** (rates, unit conversions)  
- **Probability & Statistics** (interpret & compute)  
- **One-Variable Data:** mean/median/mode  
- **Two-Variable Data:** scatterplots, regression lines

---

## Math: Geometry & Trigonometry

- **Area & Volume** (2D/3D)  
- **Right Triangles:** Pythagorean, trig ratios  
- **Circles:** angles, arcs, sectors

---

## Quiz 2 — R&W and Math Sections

1) In the **Reading & Writing** section, what does “**Command of Evidence**” require you to do?

2) For **Words in Context** questions, what’s the most reliable first step?

3) In **Expression of Ideas** items, what’s the main purpose of adding or refining **transitions**?

4) In the **Math** section, what is an efficient strategy for solving a **system of linear equations**?

5) In **Problem Solving & Data Analysis**, what is the correct formula for **percent change**?

::: notes
Answers:
1) Identify the specific lines/details in the passage that directly support your answer.
2) Read the full sentence and nearby lines to determine the word’s meaning from context—then choose the meaning that fits the passage’s tone and purpose.
3) To make relationships between ideas explicit—e.g., cause, contrast, sequence—so the paragraph flows logically.
4) Use substitution or elimination to isolate one variable, solve, then back-substitute and check the solution in both equations.
5) (new − old) ÷ old × 100%

## FUEL: Focus (Manage Distractions)

- **Internal:** anxiety, overthinking → breathing, brief reset  
- **External:** noise, interruptions → environment setup  
- **Mindfulness:** quick grounding techniques
